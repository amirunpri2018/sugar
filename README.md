==============

The package is implemented in Python and requires [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) as well as its dependencies.


Example
-------
The package includes an example. 

1. Download the following dataset and put it into the directory `data`.
	- Dataset: `mnist_rotation_back_image_new`, Rotated MNIST digits + background images
	- The `pickle data format` is required in this example, which can be download from <http://kdd2014.noahlab.com.hk/sugar/mnist_rotation_back_image_new.pkl.gz>.
	- The original dataset can be found at <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/icml2007data/mnist_rotation_back_image_new.zip>.
